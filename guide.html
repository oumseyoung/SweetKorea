                        <p>Yakgwa is a type of yumilgwa—a traditional Korean sweet made by mixing wheat flour and honey
                            into a dough and then deep-frying it in oil. Historically, yakgwa is considered Korea’s most
                            luxurious and extravagant confectionery. It
                            was widely enjoyed throughout Korean history, particularly by royalty, aristocrats, temples,
                            and common households. During the Goryeo dynasty, yakgwa was so extensively consumed that
                            historical records mention: “The royal family, aristocrats, and temples excessively produce
                            yumilgwa (oil-and-honey sweets), causing significant waste of grain, honey, and oil, leading
                            to rising prices and hardship for ordinary people.” This indicates the luxurious nature and
                            societal impact of yakgwa at the time.
                            The name Yakgwa translates to “medicinal confection,” referring to its original meaning as a
                            “medicinal sweet.” According to the works Ojuyeonmunjangjeonsango and Jibongyuseol, the
                            ingredients, especially wheat, are said to undergo growth and maturation through all four
                            seasons, symbolizing harmony with nature’s cycles. The 1948
                            publication Joseon Sangsik praised yakgwa highly: “Among all the sweets produced in Joseon,
                            yakgwa is the finest and most distinctive treat, unmatched globally due to the immense care
                            and devotion required in its preparation.” It
                            is further described as uniquely exquisite due to the meticulous craftsmanship involved.
                            Originally, yakgwa means “medicinal confectionery,” reflecting the belief in its beneficial
                            properties. Its shape has evolved—initially mimicking various fruits or birds, eventually
                            becoming round, and then square for practicality in
                            stacking during ancestral rites. Yi Ik’s Seongho Saseol mentions this shift to square-shaped
                            yakgwa, suggesting practical reasons related to ritual ceremonies.
                            Yakgwa is prepared by mixing wheat flour and honey into dough and then deep-frying it
                            thoroughly in oil. The slow frying process results in multiple flaky layers within the
                            pastry. The layers absorb honey and oil deeply, giving yakgwa its distinctly rich, sweet,
                            and aromatic flavor.</p>

                          - Hi everybody!<br>
                          Today's cookie day!<br>
                          Yakgwa.<br>
                          Yakgwa are honey cookies.<br>
                          I know some of you guys have been waiting,<br>
                          waiting for this recipe over years.<br>
                          I gotta taste my honey cookie first.<br>
                          Look at that.<br>
                          It's very soaked.<br>
                          This honey syrup is very soaked.<br>
                          Sweet and juicy inside.<br>
                          The syrup is juicy.<br>
                          A little crunchy inside.<br>
                          So delicious.<br>
                          Just one cookie makes me so very energetic.<br>
                          Are you ready to cook these cookies with me?<br>
                          Let's start.<br>
                          I always say, "This is a simple recipe, easy recipe."<br>
                          For this recipe you need a little bit skill, but if you follow me, easy.<br>
                          And I make them small portion.<br>
                          So just before I showed you, that cookie is actually double this recipe.<br>
                          I'm making with only two cups of flour.<br>
                          All-purpose wheat flour.<br>
                          One.<br>
                          Two.<br>
                          Sift.<br>
                          We gotta coat this flour in oil.<br>
                          Sesame oil, two tablespoons.<br>
                          I need three tablespoons oil.<br>
                          So two tablespoon sesame oil and one tablespoon cooking oil.<br>
                          This is grape seed oil.<br>
                          Cinnamon powder, 1/4 teaspoon.<br>
                          And then, mix.<br>
                          Using wooden spoon, or this is a rice scoop.<br>
                          I just use it this way.<br>
                          First I started with this and then you use both hands.<br>
                          Of course, you gotta wash your hands very nicely and dry.<br>
                          There are some lumps.<br>
                          You need to break this so that while I'm doing this, my flour is going to be all coated nicely in oil.<br>
                          Then, I'm going to sift this flour again.<br>
                          Like this.<br>
                          You can refrigerate and make this a couple of hours later or one hour.<br>
                          It doesn't matter.<br>
                          I'm going to make right now.<br>
                          So, why not?<br>
                          We need like three teaspoons ginger juice.<br>
                          This is a coffee filter.<br>
                          We're gonna squeeze out.<br>
                          This is a garnish for later.<br>
                          One.<br>
                          Two.<br>
                          Two teaspoon ginger juice.<br>
                          1/4 teaspoon salt.<br>
                          Black pepper.<br>
                          Just a little bit.<br>
                          Honey, 1/4 cup.<br>
                          And then, you need soju.<br>
                          When you're cooking, all this alcohol is evaporated.<br>
                          Don't worry about the alcohol intake, okay?<br>
                          So, soju, 1/2 a cup.<br>
                          Until this honey is well melted, keep stirring.<br>
                          Make dough.<br>
                          This amount.<br>
                          Don't knead because gluten is going to be created.<br>
                          Then, it's not easy to make a shape, and also, we cannot get a nice, beautiful layered kind of a shape.<br>
                          So you will see.<br>
                          I'm going to make this shape.<br>
                          (bright violin music)<br>
                          So I try to make this kind of rectangular shape.<br>
                          A good thing that I found is this to make a nice beautiful shape.<br>
                          You don't even have to use a mold, just make any shape.<br>
                          Just cut it into squares and then cook.<br>
                          (bright guitar music)<br>
                          So then, we gotta take it out.<br>
                          Heart shape.<br>
                          Valentine's Day is coming soon.<br>
                          (bright violin music)<br>
                          And then, we are going to make some holes here so that it's going to cook.<br>
                          When this cooks, through this hole it's going to expand.<br>
                          And then, we've gotta make a kind of syrup.<br>
                          The syrup, first, I will use this.<br>
                          We have to boil this.<br>
                          So one teaspoon ginger juice.<br>
                          1/2 cup water.<br>
                          And 1/2 a cup rice syrup.<br>
                          One tablespoon sugar.<br>
                          Cinnamon powder, 1/4 teaspoon.<br>
                          Then, boil this.<br>
                          Easily dripping.<br>
                          You see?<br>
                          This is all bubbles coming up.<br>
                          This syrup is done.<br>
                          This smells really, really good.<br>
                          In the old days, people like rich people, you know, our ancestors, those guys making this kind of a cookie on special occasion.<br>
                          Somebody's like, you know, birthday, New Year's day, any festival day, always they make.<br>
                          And also, you know, death anniversary.<br>
                          When they make this from this sesame oil and this rice syrup, kind of a candy smell, and the village people, their mouth waters.<br>
                          So I can imagine how much they want to taste these cookies.<br>
                          I heat up my oil over medium heat.<br>
                          We gotta be really careful because this oil is too hot.<br>
                          It's going to be burnt and also not expanding.<br>
                          Now, this is 250 Fahrenheit and I think this is the time.<br>
                          It should be like that.<br>
                          Just a little like small bubbles are coming up.<br>
                          This guy's floating now.<br>
                          Turn over.<br>
                          See?<br>
                          Turn over.<br>
                          And then, this expands.<br>
                          Look at that.<br>
                          Nice, eh?<br>
                          Expand.<br>
                          You see?<br>
                          Look at that.<br>
                          Gorgeous.<br>
                          Keep turning over and just keep cooking until this color is very light brown.<br>
                          I'm going to take it out one by one.<br>
                          This heart.<br>
                          I increased my heat, medium-high heat.<br>
                          So I wait around a couple of minutes until it reaches around 330.<br>
                          330, 350.<br>
                          Then, I will just cook this again.<br>
                          Add this.<br>
                          Keep stirring until both sides are nice, beautiful brown.<br>
                          These cookies are all done.<br>
                          I will just mix with this syrup.<br>
                          Just add.<br>
                          Mix.<br>
                          Cookie by itself is not very sweet.<br>
                          This syrup is sweet, so it has to be really soaked up.<br>
                          That's why we need at least three, four hours or overnight to soak this way.<br>
                          Sometimes you need to turn it over.<br>
                          Tomorrow, you can just drain this and serve.<br>
                          So what I'm doing is transport this to the airtight container.<br>
                          Like this.<br>
                          This way is really good.<br>
                          Cover.<br>
                          Sometimes just like this.<br>
                          Mix this way.<br>
                          Later, again, upside down like this.<br>
                          So I'm going to show you how I present.<br>
                          Look at this.<br>
                          So yakgwa, you guys can make it.<br>

                          Because just before I made this, it's not soaked yet.<br>
                          Look at that.<br>
                          Nice.<br>

                <h4>Jeonggwa</h4>

                <div class="flex-row">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Jeonggwa is a traditional Korean confectionery made by simmering relatively dry ingredients,
                            such as roots, stems, or fruits that are easily available around us, in sugar syrup and
                            grain syrup for a long time until they become chewy and sweet. Yakgwa, a type of Jeonggwa,
                            was traditionally prepared and consumed widely during the first lunar month and was
                            considered essential for various rites of passage, traditional holidays, festive gatherings,
                            and ancestral rites.
                            Yakgwa was already widely popular during the Goryeo Dynasty and enjoyed extensively among
                            royalty, nobility, Buddhist temples, and common households. Jeonggwa, meanwhile, is
                            documented in Jeong Yak-yong’s Aheongakbi
                            as being “boiled down in honey,” and thus was commonly known as a confection simmered in
                            honey. In 1815, the Gyuhap Chongseo describes methods for making Jeonggwa by boiling
                            ingredients in honey or preserving them in
                            honey for later use. Traditionally, honey was mostly used for simmering Jeonggwa, but in
                            1854, the cookbook Eumsikbeop introduced a recipe for candied citrus (gamja-jeonggwa)
                            simmered in sugar. Cookbooks detail up to 34 different types of Jeonggwa, with candied lotus
                            root (yeongeun-jeonggwa) being the most frequently mentioned. A detailed recipe for lotus
                            root Jeonggwa appeared in the 1958 Korean cookbook, Eumsik Mandeuneun Beop,
                            describing: “Wash lotus roots thoroughly, slice into coins roughly one pun thick, boil in
                            plenty of water until soft, drain the water, add three hops of honey along with sugar, then
                            simmer over charcoal fire for three hours until
                            suitably cooked, exhibiting a dark-reddish color, glossy surface, and chewy texture.”
                            Doraji Jeonggwa (candied bellflower root) follows a similar cooking method. The 1715 book
                            Sanlim Gyeongje introduced it as “Gilgyeong-ja,” describing how bellflower roots were
                            peeled, their bitterness reduced by soaking, simmered in honey, or preserved in honey, dried
                            in sunlight, and then stored for later use.
                            Candied ginger (Saenggang-jeonggwa) appears in the 1913 cookbook, Joseon Yori Jebeop: “Peel
                            ginger, slice thinly, boil in plenty of water to remove spiciness, discard water, boil again
                            in fresh water, discard again, then add 3 hops of
                            water with sugar and simmer until the quantity of liquid matches the ginger pieces, then
                            remove.”
                            Sansuyu-jeonggwa (candied cornelian cherry) is prepared by thoroughly washing and removing
                            seeds, partially drying on a tray, and then preserving in honey. Making maesil-jeonggwa
                            (candied plum) involves washing plums, drying excess water, preserving them in honey inside
                            a jar, and then drying them again on a tray before use. Yuzu-
                            jeonggwa (candied citron peel) is prepared by peeling and thinly slicing yuzu skin, briefly
                            boiling it, and draining it to maintain its characteristic aroma. Well-made Yuzu-jeonggwa is
                            notable for its subtle fragrance and rich nutritional value.</p>

                          Sagwa Jeonggwa, korean traditional apple snack<br>
                          after the roots, stems or fruits of the plant was steamed or boiled (to loosen their tissue)<br>
                          it was put(or boiled it down) honey or sugar on it then dried after applying honey or sugar is called a fruit.<br>
                          Today, I decided to make Sagwa Jeonggwa (korean traditional apple snack)<br>
                          The most popular apple for making this is Hong-ok (Jonathan apple).<br>
                          It is pretty when it was made because it's skin is dark red.<br>
                          And it is delicious because it is sour<br>
                          Soda bath for 10 minutes<br>
                          Salt water is prepared to be used to prevent the browning of apples.<br>
                          It was mostly made in the shape of a half moon.<br>
                          But these days,the shape of a doughnuts is A new trend<br>
                          So I tried to make it that way.<br>
                          I cut them carefully.<br>
                          The thickness is between 0.3 and 0.5cm.<br>
                          If it is dried in warm wind of the dryer, it will break if it is too thin.<br>
                          I recommend a thickness of about 0.5cm.<br>
                          When drying at room temperature, it dries slowly.<br>
                          It's okay to be a little thin. (0.3 to 0.5 cm)<br>
                          Soak it in salt water until put in a steamer.<br>
                          The part that is difficult to cut is cut in half-moon shape.<br>
                          Put the apples in a steamer.<br>
                          It is good to spread out and steam because red water(peel's) will dye the skin of the apple.<br>
                          When the water boils, put the steamer on top.<br>
                          The reason for steaming apples is to loosen the tissue and and absorb sugar well.<br>
                          Cool until it is lukewarm.<br>
                          put on sugar thick.<br>
                          Spread on a sieve.<br>
                          Dry in the dryer for 24 hours. (Dry to 50 degrees if Oven)<br>
                          Look at the condition rather than time and dry it until it's completely dry.<br>
                          It's better to turn it upside down once in the middle so that it can dry well.<br>
                          If drying at room temperature<br>
                          It takes longer to dry than the dryer.<br>
                          Because sugar water melts a lot.<br>
                          Put sugar on 1 to 2 times in the middle and dry it again.<br>
                          It doesn't spoil easily by applying sugar (based on fall and winter).<br>
                          Dry it as if it were left unattended for a week.<br>
                          If you feel completely dry when you touch it, it's done.<br>
                          When eaten, it feels chewy.<br>
                          It can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature.<br>
                          but I recommend this to be kept in the refrigerator in the summer. Because the sugar can melt.<br>
                          I like to put it in rice cake rather than eat it alone because it has a strong sweet taste.<br>
                          But when I want something sweet, I eat it with coffee.<br>
                          a combination of sour, sweet and bitter taste<br>
                          the repetition of sweetness and bitterness:-)<br>
                          I reached out indefinitely towards it.<br>
                          It's really  delicious.<br>
                          Sour and sweet taste penetrated all over the body.<br>
                          then it put a lot of activity energy in it<br>
                          Then, see you in the next video.<br>
                          It was a day I made Sagwa Jeongwa at Dalbangatgan.<br>

                <h4>Ddungcaron</h4>

                <div class="flex-row">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>If you love classic French macarons, you’ll be amazed by Ddungcaron—Korea’s bold and creative
                            take on this delicate dessert. The name Ddungcaron comes from the Korean word “뚱뚱하다”
                            (ddungddunghada), meaning
                            “chubby” or “fat,” and “macaron.” True to its name, Ddungcarons are extra thick and
                            generously filled, making them a visually striking and highly indulgent treat.
                            Traditional French macarons are known for their delicate, crisp shells and smooth fillings,
                            usually consisting of ganache, buttercream, or jam. In contrast, Ddungcarons are
                            significantly thicker, with an exaggerated amount of filling that can be nearly twice the
                            height of the shells. The fillings go beyond the classic flavors and often include
                            ingredients such as:
                            • Cheesecake & Cream Cheese – Rich, tangy fillings that complement the sweetness of the
                            shell.
                            • Fresh Fruits & Jams – Strawberry, mango, or raspberry jams for a fresh and tangy contrast.
                            • Cereal & Crunchy Toppings – Bits of cornflakes, cookie crumbs, or chocolate chips for
                            added texture. • Korean Flavors – Green tea, black sesame, injeolmi (roasted soybean
                            powder), and red bean.
                            Some Ddungcarons are even stuffed with whole pieces of chocolate bars, fruit slices, or even
                            mini cakes to make them more exciting. These over-the-top creations make Ddungcarons a
                            popular choice for food bloggers and dessert lovers seeking the next trendy treat.
                            The Ddungcaron trend gained momentum in Korea during the late 2010s as dessert cafés and
                            patisseries began competing to create the most unique and Instagram-worthy versions of this
                            indulgent treat. A key factor in its popularity was its strong social media appeal. With
                            their bold colors, oversized fillings, and creative designs, Ddungcarons quickly became a
                            highly photogenic dessert, making them perfect for platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Many
                            cafés took advantage of this by designing Ddungcarons with cute character faces, seasonal
                            decorations, and innovative flavor combinations, attracting both food lovers and
                            influencers.
                            Beyond social media, Korea’s vibrant dessert café culture also played a significant role in
                            the rise of Ddungcarons.
                            Koreans have a deep appreciation for dessert cafés, where aesthetic presentation and unique
                            flavors are highly valued. Ddungcarons fit seamlessly into this culture, offering a visually
                            striking and delicious treat that pairs well with coffee, milk tea, or traditional Korean
                            teas like yuzu or green tea.
                            Another factor contributing to their widespread appeal is the availability of personalized
                            and seasonal variations. Many bakeries introduce limited-edition flavors for special
                            occasions such as Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and Halloween, keeping customers excited for
                            new releases. Additionally, Ddungcarons can be customized with personalized messages, making
                            them a popular gift choice. This combination of visual appeal, café culture integration, and
                            customization options has solidified Ddungcarons as a must-try dessert in Korea.</p>
