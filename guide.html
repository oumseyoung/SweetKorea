                <h4>Yakgwa</h4>
                <div class="flex-row">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Yakgwa is a type of yumilgwa—a traditional Korean sweet made by mixing wheat flour and honey
                            into a dough and then deep-frying it in oil. Historically, yakgwa is considered Korea’s most
                            luxurious and extravagant confectionery. It
                            was widely enjoyed throughout Korean history, particularly by royalty, aristocrats, temples,
                            and common households. During the Goryeo dynasty, yakgwa was so extensively consumed that
                            historical records mention: “The royal family, aristocrats, and temples excessively produce
                            yumilgwa (oil-and-honey sweets), causing significant waste of grain, honey, and oil, leading
                            to rising prices and hardship for ordinary people.” This indicates the luxurious nature and
                            societal impact of yakgwa at the time.
                            The name Yakgwa translates to “medicinal confection,” referring to its original meaning as a
                            “medicinal sweet.” According to the works Ojuyeonmunjangjeonsango and Jibongyuseol, the
                            ingredients, especially wheat, are said to undergo growth and maturation through all four
                            seasons, symbolizing harmony with nature’s cycles. The 1948
                            publication Joseon Sangsik praised yakgwa highly: “Among all the sweets produced in Joseon,
                            yakgwa is the finest and most distinctive treat, unmatched globally due to the immense care
                            and devotion required in its preparation.” It
                            is further described as uniquely exquisite due to the meticulous craftsmanship involved.
                            Originally, yakgwa means “medicinal confectionery,” reflecting the belief in its beneficial
                            properties. Its shape has evolved—initially mimicking various fruits or birds, eventually
                            becoming round, and then square for practicality in
                            stacking during ancestral rites. Yi Ik’s Seongho Saseol mentions this shift to square-shaped
                            yakgwa, suggesting practical reasons related to ritual ceremonies.
                            Yakgwa is prepared by mixing wheat flour and honey into dough and then deep-frying it
                            thoroughly in oil. The slow frying process results in multiple flaky layers within the
                            pastry. The layers absorb honey and oil deeply, giving yakgwa its distinctly rich, sweet,
                            and aromatic flavor.</p>

                <h4>Jeonggwa</h4>

                <div class="flex-row">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Jeonggwa is a traditional Korean confectionery made by simmering relatively dry ingredients,
                            such as roots, stems, or fruits that are easily available around us, in sugar syrup and
                            grain syrup for a long time until they become chewy and sweet. Yakgwa, a type of Jeonggwa,
                            was traditionally prepared and consumed widely during the first lunar month and was
                            considered essential for various rites of passage, traditional holidays, festive gatherings,
                            and ancestral rites.
                            Yakgwa was already widely popular during the Goryeo Dynasty and enjoyed extensively among
                            royalty, nobility, Buddhist temples, and common households. Jeonggwa, meanwhile, is
                            documented in Jeong Yak-yong’s Aheongakbi
                            as being “boiled down in honey,” and thus was commonly known as a confection simmered in
                            honey. In 1815, the Gyuhap Chongseo describes methods for making Jeonggwa by boiling
                            ingredients in honey or preserving them in
                            honey for later use. Traditionally, honey was mostly used for simmering Jeonggwa, but in
                            1854, the cookbook Eumsikbeop introduced a recipe for candied citrus (gamja-jeonggwa)
                            simmered in sugar. Cookbooks detail up to 34 different types of Jeonggwa, with candied lotus
                            root (yeongeun-jeonggwa) being the most frequently mentioned. A detailed recipe for lotus
                            root Jeonggwa appeared in the 1958 Korean cookbook, Eumsik Mandeuneun Beop,
                            describing: “Wash lotus roots thoroughly, slice into coins roughly one pun thick, boil in
                            plenty of water until soft, drain the water, add three hops of honey along with sugar, then
                            simmer over charcoal fire for three hours until
                            suitably cooked, exhibiting a dark-reddish color, glossy surface, and chewy texture.”
                            Doraji Jeonggwa (candied bellflower root) follows a similar cooking method. The 1715 book
                            Sanlim Gyeongje introduced it as “Gilgyeong-ja,” describing how bellflower roots were
                            peeled, their bitterness reduced by soaking, simmered in honey, or preserved in honey, dried
                            in sunlight, and then stored for later use.
                            Candied ginger (Saenggang-jeonggwa) appears in the 1913 cookbook, Joseon Yori Jebeop: “Peel
                            ginger, slice thinly, boil in plenty of water to remove spiciness, discard water, boil again
                            in fresh water, discard again, then add 3 hops of
                            water with sugar and simmer until the quantity of liquid matches the ginger pieces, then
                            remove.”
                            Sansuyu-jeonggwa (candied cornelian cherry) is prepared by thoroughly washing and removing
                            seeds, partially drying on a tray, and then preserving in honey. Making maesil-jeonggwa
                            (candied plum) involves washing plums, drying excess water, preserving them in honey inside
                            a jar, and then drying them again on a tray before use. Yuzu-
                            jeonggwa (candied citron peel) is prepared by peeling and thinly slicing yuzu skin, briefly
                            boiling it, and draining it to maintain its characteristic aroma. Well-made Yuzu-jeonggwa is
                            notable for its subtle fragrance and rich nutritional value.</p>

                <h4>Ddungcaron</h4>

                <div class="flex-row">
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>If you love classic French macarons, you’ll be amazed by Ddungcaron—Korea’s bold and creative
                            take on this delicate dessert. The name Ddungcaron comes from the Korean word “뚱뚱하다”
                            (ddungddunghada), meaning
                            “chubby” or “fat,” and “macaron.” True to its name, Ddungcarons are extra thick and
                            generously filled, making them a visually striking and highly indulgent treat.
                            Traditional French macarons are known for their delicate, crisp shells and smooth fillings,
                            usually consisting of ganache, buttercream, or jam. In contrast, Ddungcarons are
                            significantly thicker, with an exaggerated amount of filling that can be nearly twice the
                            height of the shells. The fillings go beyond the classic flavors and often include
                            ingredients such as:
                            • Cheesecake & Cream Cheese – Rich, tangy fillings that complement the sweetness of the
                            shell.
                            • Fresh Fruits & Jams – Strawberry, mango, or raspberry jams for a fresh and tangy contrast.
                            • Cereal & Crunchy Toppings – Bits of cornflakes, cookie crumbs, or chocolate chips for
                            added texture. • Korean Flavors – Green tea, black sesame, injeolmi (roasted soybean
                            powder), and red bean.
                            Some Ddungcarons are even stuffed with whole pieces of chocolate bars, fruit slices, or even
                            mini cakes to make them more exciting. These over-the-top creations make Ddungcarons a
                            popular choice for food bloggers and dessert lovers seeking the next trendy treat.
                            The Ddungcaron trend gained momentum in Korea during the late 2010s as dessert cafés and
                            patisseries began competing to create the most unique and Instagram-worthy versions of this
                            indulgent treat. A key factor in its popularity was its strong social media appeal. With
                            their bold colors, oversized fillings, and creative designs, Ddungcarons quickly became a
                            highly photogenic dessert, making them perfect for platforms like Instagram and TikTok. Many
                            cafés took advantage of this by designing Ddungcarons with cute character faces, seasonal
                            decorations, and innovative flavor combinations, attracting both food lovers and
                            influencers.
                            Beyond social media, Korea’s vibrant dessert café culture also played a significant role in
                            the rise of Ddungcarons.
                            Koreans have a deep appreciation for dessert cafés, where aesthetic presentation and unique
                            flavors are highly valued. Ddungcarons fit seamlessly into this culture, offering a visually
                            striking and delicious treat that pairs well with coffee, milk tea, or traditional Korean
                            teas like yuzu or green tea.
                            Another factor contributing to their widespread appeal is the availability of personalized
                            and seasonal variations. Many bakeries introduce limited-edition flavors for special
                            occasions such as Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and Halloween, keeping customers excited for
                            new releases. Additionally, Ddungcarons can be customized with personalized messages, making
                            them a popular gift choice. This combination of visual appeal, café culture integration, and
                            customization options has solidified Ddungcarons as a must-try dessert in Korea.</p>
